# Twitter-Helpdesk

Imagine a company like Amazon - they get mentioned on twitter thousands of times each day. It’s humanly impossible to reply to each tweet by logging in to twitter.

Solution: They’ll use this Twitter helpdesk to connect their Twitter handle and fetch all tweets. Then they will invite their internal team members on the Helpdesk app so they can share the workload. And team members can reply to the tweets from the helpdesk.
Your app will make their lives easier. It will give them a unified view of all their tweets and give them a user friendly way to reply to the tweets.
